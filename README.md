Hi!
Well, this website has insisted that I write a short description of myself on this branch, and I can't help but feel as if I am writing some kind of online dating profile. But anyways... first and foremost, I am a stronly Catholic man who is pursuing primarily my faith, but also an incredible career in engineering, robotics, or software development. I've been incredibly gifted with a wonderful family and friends who push me to be a better man, and a love for learning and being challenged. 

And that's about all there is to it!
